Pairs Trading with Cointegration & Kalman Filters
 

Project Overview
Students will develop a statistical arbitrage strategy using pairs trading. The strategy identifies cointegrated asset pairs, estimates dynamic hedge ratios using Kalman filters, and generates trading signals based on mean reversion opportunities from using Johansen's Cointegration Test and VECM. The Kalman filter is formulated as a sequential decision process following Powell's Sequential Decision Analysis framework.

 

Objectives
Systematically identify cointegrated pairs using statistical tests
Understand and implement Kalman filters as sequential decision processes for both hedge ratios and trading signals
Develop market-neutral trading strategies with dynamic hedging and VECM from Johansen's test
Analyze strategy performance with realistic transaction costs and borrowing fees
Create clean and documented code
 

Key Concepts
Cointegration: Long-run equilibrium relationship between two time series
Mean Reversion: Exploitation of temporary deviations from equilibrium
Dynamic Hedging: Adjusting hedge ratios over time using Kalman filters
VECM: Create dynamic error correction models, stabilized using another Kalman filter
Sequential Decision Process: Real-time state estimation and optimal decision-making
Market-Neutral Strategy: Zero systematic market exposure
